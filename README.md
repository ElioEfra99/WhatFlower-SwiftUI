# WhatFlower-SwiftUI

### Welcome!!

In order to clone this project you will need to install git lfs, this is because it uses a MLModel which is somewhat heavy.

You can visit [this website](https://git-lfs.com) to download Git-lfs.

After you successfully installed Git-lfs for the first time and have the project cloned, you'll have to go to the project's path and execute `git lfs install`

Then you run `git lfs fetch` in order to actually download the git lfs files (the MLModel)

Once you do this, you're good to go!!
